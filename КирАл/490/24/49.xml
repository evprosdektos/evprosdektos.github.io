<p ><div>The Saviour promises the disciples the descent of the Holy Spirit, which God had announced of old by Joel, and power from above, that they might be strong and invincible, and without all fear preach to men everywhere the divine mystery.<br /><br />He says to them now that they had received the Spirit after the resurrection, "Receive you the Holy Spirit," and adds, <b>"But tarry you at Jerusalem, and wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard of Me.</b> For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;" in water no longer, for that they had received, but with the Holy Spirit: He does not add water to water, but completes that which was deficient by adding what was wanting to it.<br /><br /></div></p>
