{"xml":"<p ><div>CHRIST has somewhere said, \"The kingdom of heaven is like to a treasure hid in a field.\" And there is nothing more certain than that those who love lucre, and seek for treasures, most certainly do not find them ready for them, nor placed above ground, but hidden rather and buried out of sight; and only by digging laboriously do they find them, and that with difficulty. Come therefore, and let us seek after the knowledge of the lessons of the Gospel as for some treasure; let us search deep into the thoughts therein contained: for so shall we find what we seek by Christ revealing this also to us: \"for in Him are all the treasures of wisdom, and the hidden things of knowledge;\" and He is the Giver of wisdom and understanding to the whole rational creation.<br /><br />What therefore does He say to the chiefs of the Jews, when setting forth to them those things which are useful for salvation? \"<b>A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went on a journey for a long time.\"</b> Now if any one will examine with the penetrating eyes of the mind the purport of what is here said, he will find the whole history of the children of Israel briefly summed up in these words. For who the man is who planted the vineyard, and what, in fact, is to be understood by the vineyard which was planted, the Psalmist makes clear, where he says to Christ, the Saviour of all, respecting the Israelites; \"You brought a vine out of Egypt; You removed the nations, and planted it: You made a way before it, and planted its roots, and it filled the land.\" And further, the blessed prophet Isaiah also, declaring this very thing, says, \"My beloved had a vineyard on a hill, in a fertile place.\" And afterwards he adds thereto, making more evident the force of what had been spoken enigmatically, \"For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the man of Judah. a plant new and beloved.\" He therefore Who planted the vineyard is God; Who also went abroad for a long time. And yet God fills every thing, and in no way whatsoever is absent from any thing that exists; how therefore did the Lord of the vineyard go abroad for a long time? It means, that after He had been seen by them in the shape of fire at His descent upon Mount Sinai with Moses, who spoke to them the law as the mediator, He did not again grant them His presence in a visible manner, but, to use a metaphor taken from human affairs, His relation to them was, so to speak, like that of one who had made a long journey abroad.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=20&v=8\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=20&v=10\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
