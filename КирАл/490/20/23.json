{"xml":"<p ><div>How therefore did Christ overcome their craftiness? \"<b>Show Me, </b>He says, <b>a denarius.\"</b> And when it was shown Him, again He asks, <b>\"Whose is the image upon it and superscription? And they said, Caesar's.</b>\" And what does Christ reply thereto? \"<b>Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.</b>\" For those whose office it is to govern impose a tribute of money upon their subjects: but God requires of us of things corruptible and transitory even nothing, but rather willing obedience and submission; faith and love; and the sweet savour of good works. These things the Israelites ought to have offered to God: but they were careless and contemptuous, and too ready to betake themselves to every thing that was base.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=20&v=22\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=20&v=26\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
