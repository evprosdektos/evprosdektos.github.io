<p ><div>Observe the great malice of the Pharisees: they flee from the truth; they refuse the light; they feel no horror at committing sin. And they were afraid indeed to speak the truth, lest they should be told, Why then did you not believe Him? but neither will they accuse the forerunner, not however from being afraid of God, but rather of the multitudes. And therefore they hide the truth, and say, "<b>We know not."</b></div></p>
