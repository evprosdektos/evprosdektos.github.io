{"xml":"<p ><div>FROM Christ we have received the knowledge of things about to happen: for it is even He Who \"reveals the deep things out of darkness,\" and knows those that are hidden: and \"in Him are all the treasures of wisdom, and the hidden things of knowledge.'\" He changes times and seasons: and refashions the creation to that which it was at the beginning. For it was by His means that when it existed not, it was brought into existence according to the will of God the Father: for He is His living and personal power and wisdom: and again by His means it will easily be changed into that which is better. For as His disciple says, \"We expect new heavens, and a new earth, and His promises.\" <br />Now the cause of this digression has been in part the question put to our common Saviour Christ respecting the temple, and the things therein, and partly the answer He made thereto. For some of them showed Him the mighty works that were in the temple, and the beauty of the offerings; expecting that He would admire as they did the spectacle, though He is God, and heaven is His throne. </div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=21&v=3\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=21&v=6\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
