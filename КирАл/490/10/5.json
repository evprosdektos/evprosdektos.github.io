For it would have been a most disgraceful act for them to wish to be intimate with any who were still resisting Christ's glory, and guilty of the charge of ungodliness. \"For what part hath the believer with the unbeliever?\" For how could those who had not as yet even listened to their words, but made their instruction, however worthy it was of being embraced, an occasion sometimes even of ridicule, receive them as meriting their admiration? So too at Athens some once ridiculed the divine Paul. For he indeed taught them \"that God dwelleth not in temples made with hands,\" being incorporeal and infinite, and That Which filleth all, but is contained by none: and declared that he preached unto them \"Him Whom though they knew Him not, they imagined they rightly worshipped.\" But they being given up to superciliousness, and greatly priding themselves on their fluent tongue, said in their folly, \"What would this seed-picker say? For he seemeth to be a setter forth of foreign gods.\" Seed-picker was the name they gave to a worthless bird, whose habit it was to pick up the seeds scattered on the roads: and in comparing to it the divine Paul, these foolish men were ridiculing the word of salvation then offered them.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=10&v=4\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=10&v=7\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
