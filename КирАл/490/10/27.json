Let us therefore cry out against him in the words of Jeremiah, \"You are found, and caught, because you have stood up against the Lord.\"</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=10&v=26\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=10&v=29\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
