{"xml":"<p ><div><b>\"But,\"</b> says He, <b>\"you shall not see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is he that comes in the Name of the Lord.\"</b> And what again is this? The Lord withdrew from Jerusalem, and left as unworthy of His presence those who said, \"Depart and go hence.\" And afterwards having traversed Judaea, and saved many, and performed miracles which no words can adequately describe, He returned again to Jerusalem. And then it was, even then, that He sat upon a foal and an ass, while vast multitudes and young children, holding up branches of palm-trees, went before Him, praising Him, and saying, \"Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is He That comes in the Name of the Lord.\" Having left them therefore as being unworthy, He says that He will then barely be seen by them when the time of His passion has arrived. For then again He went up to Jerusalem, and entered amid praises, and at that very time endured His saving passion in our behalf, that by suffering He might save, and renew unto incorruption the inhabitants of the earth. For God the Father has saved us by Christ: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. </div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=13&v=34\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=14&v=1\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
