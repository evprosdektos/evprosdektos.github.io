Which of the holy prophets ever spoke ought such as this? or used words of so great authority? For observe that He did not ask of another the power to restore vision to him who was deprived of sight, nor did He perform the divine miracle as the effect of prayer to God, but attributed it rather to His own power, and by His almighty will wrought whatever He would. <b>"Receive, said He, your sight;</b>" and the word was light to him that was blind: for it was the word of Him Who is the true light.</div></p>
