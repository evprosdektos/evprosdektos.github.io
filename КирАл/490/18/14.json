{"xml":"<p ><div>And what is the result? Let us hear what the Judge says, <b>\"This man, He says, went down to his house justified rather than the other.\"</b><br />Let us therefore \"pray without ceasing,\" according to the expression of the blessed Paul: but let us be careful to do so aright. The love of self is displeasing to God, and He rejects empty haughtiness and a proud look, puffed up often on account of that which is by no means excellent. And even if a man be good and sober, let him not on this account suffer himself to fall away into shameful pride: but rather let him remember Christ, Who says to the holy apostles, \"When you have done all those things, those namely which have been commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do.'' For we owe unto God over all, as from the yoke of necessity, the service of slaves, and ready obedience in all things. Yes, though you lead an excellent and elect life, don't exact wages from the Lord; but rather ask of Him a gift. As being good, He will promise it you: as a loving Father, He will aid you. Restrain not yourself then from saying, \"God be merciful to me the sinner.\" Remember Him Who says by the voice of Isaiah, \"Declare you your sins first, that you may be justified:\" remember too that He rebukes those who will not do so, and says, \"Behold, I have a judgment against you, because you say 'I have not sinned'.\" Examine the words of the saints: for one says, \"The righteous is the accuser of himself in the beginning of his words.\" And another again, \"I said, I will confess against myself my transgression unto the Lord: and you forgave the iniquity of my heart.\"<br />What answer then will those make to this, who embrace the new tenets of Novatus, and say of themselves that they are pure? Whose prayer do they praise? That of the Pharisee, who acquitted himself, or that of the Publican, who accused himself? If they say that of the Pharisee, they resist the divine sentence; for he was condemned as being boastful: but if that of the Publican, why do they refuse to acknowledge their own impurity? Certainly God justifies those who know well their transgressions, and are willing to confess them: but these men will have the portion of the Pharisee.<br />We then say, that in many things we \"all of us offend,\" and that no man is pure from uncleanness, even though his life upon earth be but one day. Let us ask then of God mercy; which if we do, Christ will justify us: by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father, be praise and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, Amen. </div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=18&v=13\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=18&v=15\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
