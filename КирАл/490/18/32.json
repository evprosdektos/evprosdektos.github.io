{"xml":"<p ><div>And He added necessarily, that all these things had been foretold by the holy prophets. For Isaiah, as in the person of Christ, says; \"I have given My back to scourgings, and My cheeks to buffetings: and My face I have not turned away from the shame of spittings.\" And again, in another place, He says of Him, \"As a sheep He was led to the slaughter, and was silent, as a lamb before its shearer.\" And again, \"All we like sheep have gone astray: every one has gone astray in his path: and the Lord has delivered Him up because of our sins.\" And again the blessed David also in the twenty-first 1 Psalm, painting as it were beforehand the sufferings upon the cross, has set before us Jesus speaking as one that lo! already was hanging upon the tree, \"But I am a worm, and not a man: the reproach of men, and a thing rejected of the people. All those that have seen Me, have derided Me: they have spoken with their lips, and shaken their heads; He trusted in the Lord: let Him deliver Him.\" For some of the Jews did shake their wicked heads at Him, deriding Him, and saying, \"If You are the Son of God, come down now from the cross, and we will believe You.\" And again He said, \"They parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture they cast the lot.\" And again in another place He says of those that crucified Him, \"They gave gall for My food, and for My thirst they made Me drink vinegar.\"<br />Of all therefore that was about to happen to Him, nothing was unforetold, God having so ordered it by His Providence for our use, that when the time came for it to happen, no one might be offended. For it was in the power of one Who knew beforehand what was about to happen, to refuse to suffer altogether.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=18&v=31\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=18&v=33\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
