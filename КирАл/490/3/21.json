{"xml":"<p ><div>AGAIN come, that fixing our mind intently upon the Evangelic Scriptures, we may behold the beauty of the truth. Come let us direct the penetrating and accurate eyes of the mind unto the mystery of Christ; let us view with wonder the admirable skill of the divine economy: for so shall we see His glory. And thus to act is for our life: as He Himself assures us, when speaking unto God the Father in heaven, \"Those things are life eternal: to know Thee Who alone art true; and Jesus Christ, Whom Thou hast sent.\" How therefore was He sent? and what was the manner of His coming unto us? For being by nature God That filleth all, how, as the blessed John the Evangelist said, \"was He in the world,\" Himself being Lord? And how was He sent by the Father, when as God He is the Creator and Sustainer of all things? for all things were established by Him.<br /><br />The wise John the Evangelist then teaches us, saying, \"And the Word was made flesh.\" But perchance some one will say, 'What then? Having ceased to be the Word, did He change into being flesh? Did He fall from His Majesty, having undergone a transformation unto something which previously He was not?' Not so, we say. Far from it. For by nature He is unchangeable and immutable. In saying, therefore, that the Word became flesh, the Evangelist means a man like unto us. For we also are often called flesh ourselves. For it is written, \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God,\" meaning thereby that every man shall see it. While therefore He immutably retains that \"which He was, yet as having under this condition assumed our likeness, He is said to have been made flesh.<br /><br />Behold Him, therefore, as a man, enduring with us the things that belong to man's estate, and fulfilling all righteousness, for the plan of salvation's sake. And this thou learnest from what the Evangelist says:<b> \"And it came to pass that when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized, and prayed.</b>\" Was He too then in need of holy baptism? But what benefit could accrue to Him from it? The Only-begotten Word of God is Holy of the Holy: so the Seraphim name Him in their praises: so every where the law names Him: and the company of the holy prophets accords with the writings of Moses. What is it that we gain by holy baptism? Plainly the remission of our sins. But in Jesus there was nought of this; \"for He did no sin: neither was guile found \"in His mouth,\" as the Scripture saith. \"He was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sins, and made higher than the heavens,\" according to the words of the divine Paul...<br />And the Evangelist says that the <b>heavens were opened</b>, as having long been closed. For Christ said, \"Forthwith shall ye see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\" For both the flock above and that below being now made one, and one chief Shepherd appointed for all, the heavens were opened, and man upon earth brought near to the holy angels. And the Spirit also again came down as at a second commencement of our race: and upon Christ first, Who received it not so much for His own sake as for ours: for by Him and in Him are we enriched with all things. Most suitably therefore to the economy of grace does He endure with us the things of man's estate: for where otherwise shall we see Him emptied, Whose in His divine nature is the fulness? How became He poor as we are, if He were not conformed to our poverty? How did He empty Himself, if He refused to endure the measure of human littleness?</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=3&v=17\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=3&v=22\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
