<div><p ><div>But that he may benefit in a still higher degree those that hear him, the blessed Baptist brings forward something more: <b>"But already even the axe is laid at the root of the trees."</b> But by the axe in this passage he signifies the sharp wrath which God the Father brought upon the Jews for their wickedness towards Christ, and audacious violence: for the wrath was brought upon them like an axe. And this the prophet Zecharias has explained to us, saying, "The wailing of Jerusalem shall be as the wailing of a grove of pomegranate trees cut down in the plain." And Jeremiah also addressing her, said, "The Lord called thy name a beautiful olive tree, very leafy to behold: at the sound of its felling, a fire was kindled upon it: great was the lamentation over it: its branches have been made unserviceable: and the Lord of hosts That planted thee hath uttered evils against thee." And to this thou mayest add also the parable in the Gospels about the fig-tree. As being therefore a plant unfruitful, and no longer of generous kind, it was cut down by God. He does not, however, say that the axe was laid into the root, but at the root, that is, near the root. For the branches were cut off, but the plant was not dug up by its root: for the remnant of Israel was saved, and did not perish utterly. </div></p>
