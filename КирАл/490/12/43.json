{"xml":"<p ><div>When therefore, He says, he shall return, if on coming to his house he shall find him so doing as he commanded, very blessed shall that servant be. For he will set him, He says, over all that he has. <br />Whoever therefore shall wisely in due season, and according to their need, divide to his fellow-servants their portion, that is, their food, very blessed shall he be, according to the Saviour's word. For he shall be counted worthy of still greater things, and shall receive a suitable recompense for his fidelity. \"For he will set him, He says, over all that he has.\" And this the Saviour has elsewhere taught us, where praising the active and faithful servant, He said, \"O good and faithful servant, you have been faithful over few things, I will set you over many things: enter into the joy of your lord.\"</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=12&v=42\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=12&v=45\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
