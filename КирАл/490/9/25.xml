<p ><div>But that it is incomparably better, far above the splendour and pleasure of the world, to excel in the love of Christ, He shows us by saying, "<b>For what is a man profited who hath gained the whole world, but hath lost himself, or fallen short?"</b> For when a man looks chiefly to that which is pleasant and profitable for the moment, and therefore avoids suffering, and desires to live joyously, even though he have wealth and abundance of possessions, yet what profit hath he therefrom when he has lost himself? "Treasures profit not the wicked," but "the fashion of this world passeth away:" and "like clouds those pleasures recede," and riches flies away from those that possess it: "but righteousness delivereth from death."</div></p>
