{"xml":"<p ><div><b>And when there was the voice,\"</b> it says, <b>\"Jesus was found alone.\" </b>What then will he who is disputatious and disobedient, and whose heart is incurable, say to these things? Lo! Moses is there, and does the Father command the holy apostles to hear him? Had it been His will that they should follow the commandments of Moses, He would have said, I suppose, Obey Moses; keep the law. But this was not what God the Father here said, but in the presence of Moses and the prophets, He commands them rather to hear Him. And that the truth might not be subverted by any, affirming that the Father rather bade them hear Moses, and not Christ the Saviour of us all, the Evangelist has clearly marked it, saying, \"<b>When there was the voice, Jesus was found alone.\" </b>When therefore God the Father, from the cloud overhead, commanded the holy apostles, saying, \"Hear Him,\" Moses was far away, and Elijah too was no longer nigh; but Christ was there alone. Him therefore He commanded them to obey.<br /><br />For He also is the end of the law and the prophets: for which reason He cried aloud to the multitudes of the Jews: \"If ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed Me also: for he wrote of Me 10.\" But as they persevered even unto the end in despising the commandment given by most wise Moses, and in rejecting the word of the holy prophets, they have justly been alienated and expelled from those blessings that were promised to their fathers. For \"obedience is better than sacrifices, and to hearken than the fat of rams,\" as the Scripture saith. And thus much then of the Jews: but upon us who have acknowledged the revelation, all these blessings have necessarily been bestowed, by means of and as the gift of the same Christ: by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen. </div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=9&v=34\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=9&v=38\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
