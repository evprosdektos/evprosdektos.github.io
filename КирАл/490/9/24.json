If, therefore, a man be ready to endure and despise the terrors of death, has he lost himself and departed, and is there nothing more in store for him? By no means: for in that he loses his life, he especially finds it; while to find it is to bring upon himself destruction. What fear, therefore, can the saints now feel, if that which seemed to be hard proves rather joyous to them that bear it; while that which is dear to men, as being exempt from pain, leads them especially downwards to destruction and the snare of hell, according to the Scripture.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=9&v=23\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=9&v=25\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
