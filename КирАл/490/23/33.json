{"xml":"<p ><div>For our sakes He became a curse, that is, accursed: for it is written again, that \"Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree.\" But this act of His did away with the curse that was upon us: for we with Him and because of Him are blessed. And knowing this, the blessed David says: \"Blessed are we of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth:\" for by His sufferings blessings descend to us. He in our stead paid our debts: He bore our sins; and as it is written, \"in our stead He was stricken.\" \"He took them up in His own body on the tree:\" for it is true that \"by His bruises we are healed.\" He too was sick because of our sins, and we are delivered from the sicknesses of the soul.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=23&v=32\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=23&v=34\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
