{"xml":"<p ><div>And this it was their lot to suffer. For they were given up to destruction and slaughter, and perished together with their whole race. \"<b>For they cried out, it says, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him.\"</b> And this their unholy cry the Lord blamed, saying, by the voice of Jeremiah, \"I have left My house, I have abandoned My inheritance: I have given My dearly beloved, My soul, into the hand of her enemies. My inheritance has become to Me like a lion in a thicket: it has uttered its voice against Me; therefore I have hated it.\" It was hated therefore because as a lion it sprang upon Christ, and uttered a cruel and pitiless cry against Him: but we praise Christ, Who for our sakes and in our stead suffered in the flesh: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and over. Amen. </div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=23&v=18\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=23&v=22\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
