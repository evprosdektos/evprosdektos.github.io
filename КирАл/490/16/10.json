{"xml":"<p ><div>THE most distinguished and experienced teachers, when they wish to fix any important doctrine deep in the minds of their disciples, omit no kind of reasoning able to throw light upon the chief object of their thoughts; at one time weaving arguments together, at another employing apposite examples, and so gathering from every quarter whatever is serviceable for their use. And this we find Christ also, Who is the Giver unto us of all wisdom, doing in many places. For oftentimes He repeats the very same arguments upon the subject, whatever it may be, that the mind of those who hear may be led on to an exact understanding of His words. For look again, I pray, at the purport of the lessons set before us: for so you will find our words to be true. \"<b>He that is faithful in little,\" He says, \"is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in little, is unjust also in much.\"</b><br />Before, however, I proceed further, I think it would be useful to consider, what was the occasion of a discourse such as this, and from what root it sprung: for so the sense of what is said will become very evident. Christ then was teaching the rich to feel especial delight in showing kindness to the poor, and in opening their hand to whoever are in need, so laying up treasures in heaven, and taking forethought for the riches that are in store. For He said, \"Make for yourselves friends of the unrighteous mammon: that when it has failed, they may receive you into eternal tabernacles.\" But as being God by nature, He well knew the slothfulness of the human mind in every earnest and good work. It escaped not His knowledge, that men, in their greediness after wealth, giving up their mind to the love of lucre, and being tyrannized over by this passion, become hard-hearted and unsympathizing with affliction, and show no kindness whatsoever to the poor, even though they have heaped up much wealth in their stores. That those therefore who are thus minded, have no share in God's spiritual gifts, He shows by most evident examples, and says, <b>\"He that is faithful in little, is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in little, is unjust also in much.</b>\" O Lord, explain unto us the meaning: open You the eye of our heart.<br />Продолжение - в <a href=\"/bible-index/bible/?b=490&c=16&s=11\"><span><span class=\"verse-text\"><span class=\"align-super\">11</span> Итак, если вы в неправедном богатстве не были верны, кто поверит вам истинное?</span></span>Лк. 16:11</a></div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=16&v=1\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=16&v=11\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
