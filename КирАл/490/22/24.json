{"xml":"<p ><div>\"AWAKE you, and watch,\" is the summons to us of one of the holy apostles: for every where the net of sin is spread, and Satan makes us his prey in various ways, seizing hold of us by many passions, and so leading us on to a reprobate mind. Those therefore must be awake who would not willingly be subject to his power: for thereby they will gain the victory by Christ's help, Who cares for our souls, and delivers them from every passion, that so with sound and vigorous mind they may run along the praiseworthy and gainful pathway of that mode of life which is pleasing to Him. For how great His mercy is towards us, the purport of the lessons set before us once again declares. For the disciples had given way to a human infirmity, and were contending with one another, who of them is the chief, and superior to the rest; for those perchance who held the second rank among them were not willing to give way to those who held the first. But even this arose, and was recorded for our benefit, that that which happened to the holy apostles may prove a reason for humility in us.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=22&v=22\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=22&v=25\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
