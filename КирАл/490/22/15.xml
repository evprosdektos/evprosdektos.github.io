<p ><div>And what did Christ also say to the holy apostles? <b>"I have desired a desire to eat this passover with you." </b>Let us examine the deep purport of this expression: let us search out the meaning concealed therein, and what it is which the Saviour intends.<br />As then I have already said that covetous disciple was seeking an opportunity to betray Him: and, that he might not deliver Him to His murderers before the feast of the passover, the Saviour did not declare either the house or the person with whom He would celebrate the feast. To explain therefore to them the cause of His unwillingness openly to tell them with whom He would lodge, He says, "<b>I have desired a desire to eat with you this passover</b>:" apparently meaning, I have used all diligence to enable me to escape the wickedness of the traitor, that I might not endure My passion before the time.</div></p>
