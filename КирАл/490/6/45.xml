<p ><div> We must decide, then, the character of the teacher, not by appearances, but by the acts of each one's life. <br />This is also made clear by another declaration of our Lord: <b>"for the good man, He says, as out of a good treasure, poureth forth from the heart good things:</b>" but he who is differently disposed, and whose mind is the prey of fraud and wickedness, necessarily brings forth what is concealed deep within. For the things that are in the mind and heart boil over, and are vomited forth by the outflowing stream of speech. The virtuous man, therefore, speaks such things as become his |character, while he who is worthless and wicked vomits forth his secret impurity.<br />Every thing, therefore, that is to our benefit, Christ teaches us, and requires His disciples to be on their guard against deceit, and vigilant and careful. For this reason He shews them the straight way, and discloses the snares that lead down to wickedness, that thus escaping from offences, and being steadfast in mind beyond risk of sin, they may quickly reach the mansions that are above by Christ's blessing: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion with the Holy Ghost for ever and ever, Amen.</div></p>
