Observe here, I pray, the great skill of the management. For though He well knew that the damsel was dead, He said, \"<b>She is not dead, but rather sleepeth.</b>\" For what reason?<br />And let no man affirm that Christ spake untruly. For to Him, as being Life by nature, there is nothing dead. And this is the reason why we, having a firm hope of the resurrection of the dead, call them \"those that sleep.\" For in Christ they will arise: and, as the blessed Paul says, \"They live to Him,\" in that they are about to live.</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=8&v=51\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=8&v=53\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
