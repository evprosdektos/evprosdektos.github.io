{"xml":"<p ><div>And the sense of the parable which immediately follows is exactly similar, in which, He says, that 'a woman who had ten drachms lost one of them, and having lit a lamp and found it, rejoiced greatly therein, and made it a reason for special joy.' By the former parable therefore, in which the wandering sheep signified the family upon earth, we learnt, that we are the property of God over all, in that He it is Who brought into existence those things which previously had no existence. For \"He made us, and not we ourselves,\" as it is written. And \"He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.\" And by this second parable, in which that which was lost is compared to a drachma, and that again as one out of ten, that is of a perfect number, and of a sum complete in the reckoning;----for the number ten also is perfect, being the close of the series from the unit upwards;----it is clearly shown, that we are in the royal likeness and image, even that of God over all. For the drachma is, I suppose, the denarius, on which is stamped the royal likeness, That we then who had fallen, and, so to speak, been lost, have been found by Christ, and transformed by holiness and righteousness into His image, how can any one doubt, when the blessed Paul has thus written, \"But we all, with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as of the Lord the Spirit.\" And he sends to the Galatians also in these words, \"My children, of whom I am again in labour, until Christ is formed in you.\"<br />A search then was made for that which had fallen, for which purpose the woman lighted a lamp. For we were found, as I said, by the wisdom of God the Father, Which is the Son, when the divine and intellectual light shone upon us, and the sun arose, and \"the day star ascended, and the day dawned,\" according to the Scripture. For God also has somewhere said by one of the holy prophets of Christ the Saviour of us all, \"My righteousness quickly approaches, and My mercy to be revealed, and My salvation shall burn as a lamp.\" And He says of Himself, at one time, \"I am the light of the world:\" and again at another, \"I am come a light into this world: he that follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall possess the light of life.\"</div></p>\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<a id=\"left_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=15&v=7\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"bottom_home\" href=\"/commentaries/footnotes/?f=1044&m=%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%90%D0%BB\">&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n<a id=\"right_arrow\" href=\"/commentaries/?b=490&c=15&v=9\">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a>\r\n</div>\r\n"}
