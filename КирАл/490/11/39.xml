<p ><div>But what said the Saviour? He most opportunely rebuked them, saying, "<b>Now you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup, and the dish; but that which is within you is full of rapine and wickedness.</b>" For it would have been easy for the Lord to have used other words with the view of instructing the foolish Pharisee, but He found an opportunity, and, so to speak, connects His teaching with what was before their eyes. For as it was the time of eating, and of sitting at table, He takes as a plain comparison the cup and the dish, and shows that those who sincerely serve God must be pure and clean, not only from bodily impurity, but also from that hidden within in the mind; just, for instance, as those utensils also that serve the table must be cleansed both from those impurities that are on the outside, and also as well from those that are within.</div></p>
